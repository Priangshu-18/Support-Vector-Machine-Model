# Support Vector Machine Model

This repository contains an implementation of a Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier using Python.  
The project demonstrates how to train and evaluate an SVM model for binary classification tasks.

## üìå Overview

Support Vector Machines (SVM) are powerful supervised learning models used for classification and regression.  
This project showcases the use of SVM for solving a binary classification problem using `scikit-learn`.


## ‚ú® Features

- SVM classifier using scikit-learn
- Data preprocessing and visualization
- Model training and performance evaluation
- Accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score metrics
